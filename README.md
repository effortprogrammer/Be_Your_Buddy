# Be_Your_Buddy

## Introduction
 
  This application uses azure technologies to help people who suffered from extreme stress or depressed people. The key point of our application 
 is not treating these people to be patients, but trying to be their caring friend.  
 
 ## Objective
 The objective of this application is to listen stories of people who were wanted to be taken care of, felt depressed, or currently suffering mental health issues based on azure cognitive services. I wanted to make this product since because of COVID-19, more people suffered mental health issues or depression. 
 
 Comparing with the increase of patients, current amounts of counselors or mental therapists having hard time to spend enough time to each patients. Also, some people have hard time to visit in hospital because they don’t want to think themselves as a mental health patients. Our application determines each person’s sentiment with their text data, and matched them to counselor or therapists. When people matched their counselor successfully, chat data will be sent to therapists to learn some background of their clients and to make fast and accurate decision with same amounts of time.
