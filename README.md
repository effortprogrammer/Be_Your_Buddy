# Be_Your_Buddy

## Introduction
 
  This application uses azure technologies to help people who have mental health issues. We’d like to be a buddy to make anyone inclusively be able to access mental health care services regardless of socioeconomic status, practical issues, and conditions.
 
 ## Objective
 
 The objective of this application is to listen and empathize with people with mental health issues and be good friends with them. When they are having a hard time, or they need empathy, comfort, and encouragement, Buddy, our psychotherapy chatbot service, always be there for them. 
Compared to the increase of people with mental health issues, relatively few people are seeking help due to stigma, paying for treatment, accessibility, denial and fear of treatment, etc. 

To solve these problems, our application determines each person’s sentiment with their text data, and gives them appropriate responses. Therefore, we can make them feel like they are actually talking to a mental health counselor. 
Furthermore, when a user wants to consult a professional doctor one-to-one, we can match them to the psychiatrist. When they matched their psychiatrist successfully, chat data will be sent to psychiatrists to learn some background and to make fast and accurate decisions with the same amounts of time.
